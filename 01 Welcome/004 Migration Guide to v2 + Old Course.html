<p><strong> If you bought this course AFTER&nbsp;2020, then please just skip this lecture </strong></p><p><br></p><p> But <strong>if you bought the older course version (BEFORE&nbsp;2020) and already watched it</strong>, then here is all the information about this new course version!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) How do I access the old course?</strong></p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The old course <strong>will be available forever</strong>, in a new private course. Just <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course-legacy/?password=JSUNSET" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">click this link</a> and enroll (password is "JSUNSET", if asked) </p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> The old course is also available for download at the end of the course (Section 21), in the section called "[LEGACY] Access the Old Course". Downloads include all videos and English captions. Scroll to the end of the course to learn more </p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) What is new in version 2?</strong></p><p>This new course version:</p><ul><li><p>Has 65+ hours of video content;</p></li><li><p>Is modern from the beginning, with a strong focus on ES6+ (even ES2020) features;</p></li><li><p>Features more and better projects;</p></li><li><p>Contains 25+ coding challenges and 25+ assignments;</p></li><li><p>Has better and deeper explanations of every single topic;</p></li><li><p>Has even better and more theory videos, so that you can truly master JS!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Which sections should I watch?</strong></p><p>Below are all the new sections, color-coded according to their <strong>relevance for students who watched the course previously</strong>, along with an explanation of what's changed (you can download a high-res PDF&nbsp;of this from the resources of this lecture ).</p><p>The starter code is still in the <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">same repo on GitHub</a>, you will have to download the code again.</p><p>Here is what the colors mean:</p><ul><li><p>Dark green sections are <strong>very relevant</strong>, because they contain topics that were previously not covered. You should watch them </p></li><li><p>Green sections are also <strong>good to know</strong>, because they dive even deeper into topics than the previous course, with better explanations and additional topics;</p></li><li><p>Light green sections can <strong>safely be skipped</strong>, you won't learn much new stuff there, unless you want more and better projects (Mapty and Forkify).</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-19_13-36-38-e0716fdd0ec2a0b85028aa3a7d834f72.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>4) What about my course progress?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, your progress has been reset by all this new material </p><p>But look at the bright side, you just got a new 65-hour course 100% for free </p><p>So, just watch the new content to bring you up-to-date, according to the information in point 3). Then, simply <strong>mark the rest of the videos that you didn't watch as completed</strong>. I know, that's not super fun to do, but it will only take you 10 minutes. Again, it's hopefully worth it for the huge upgrade you got.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5) Feedback</strong></p><p>If your opinion of the course has changed after this update, then <strong>please update your review </strong> to reflect that. Maybe you previously commented that the course was outdated? Well, not anymore :)</p><p>I would really appreciate it!</p><p>And now, have fun with your new course! </p>
